# ComputerKeyboardComboCalculator
<p>For Shopify's Shopicruit challenge as a part of their internship application.</p>
<b> Description of the task: </b>
<p>You've discovered the Shopify Store 'Shopicruit'. Since you're obsessed with computers, you want to buy every 
single computer and keyboard variant they have to offer. Unfortunately you can only carry up to 100kg and may not 
be able to buy all of them. By inspecting the JavaScript calls on the store you discovered that the shop lists 
products at http://shopicruit.myshopify.com/products.json. Write a program that calculates what the maximum amount 
of computers and keyboards that you could carry would cost you. Attach your answer (in dollars) and your program 
(any language) and answer in your reply.</p>
